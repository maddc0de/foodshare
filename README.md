# Foodshare project

## Overview
Food waste is a huge issue. In the UK alone, we throw away around [9.5 million tonnes of food](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/food-waste-in-the-uk/) every year. Yet, there is a [surging demand for food banks](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/food-bank-demand-and-the-rising-cost-of-living/), with many turning to them for the first time. This project aims to tackle both of these problems, to reduce food waste and help those most in need.

Foodshare is a food waste app, which connects food banks to local restaurants, supermarkets and other food outlets who wish to donate their surplus food.

Our motto is “Waste not, want it”.

Foodshare has two types of users:
* Food heroes: supermarkets, restaurants and other food outlets who wish to donate their surplus food.
* Food rescuers: food banks who will receive the surplus food and distribute it to local households in need.

Note that the app acts as an intermediary and does not arrange for the collection and delivery of food. Food banks will be required to collect the food packages themselves. As such, the app aims to connect local donors to local food banks.

## Features

The app uses the MERN stack, with the programming languages HTML, CSS and React (JavaScript). When the user enter the homepage, they have the option to log in either as a food hero (food outlet and donor) or as a food rescuer (food bank and donee). They will then have a different user experience. 

### Food hero
The food hero will be provided with a donation form that they must complete. It will include a description of the food, collection location, time and so on. They will also be able to see a list of requests from local food banks. Whenever a collection has been booked by a food rescuer, the food hero will receive a notification of the booking, along with an ID. The ID  will be used by the food hero to verify the identificatication of the food rescuer. The food rescuer will also be able to download an impact report that details the outcomes of their donations.

### Food rescuer
The food bank will be able to see a map/list view of local food heroes and the available food packages. They will be able to filter this view for religious or dietary requirements. When a food bank finds a food hero that they wish to collect from, they can book a collection time. They will then receive a confirmation of the booking and an ID, which they will show to the food rescuer to confirm their identity. When a food bank has agreed to collect the food package, it will be removed from the map/list view. However, if the food rescuer does not collect the package within their alloted time slot, the package will be reuploaded onto the app.
